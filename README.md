# Charles-neovim-config
My neovim configuration requires rg (ripgrep). UPDATE I have simplified and I am now using normal system grep and vimgrep.

On Mac you will need to run some confusion with python versions. This can also be fixed using pyenv but I like this more
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim
