# Charles-neovim-config
This is my neovim configuration, I have made the configuration custom without any plugins. Requires lua-language-server, and also typescript-language-server.

On Mac you may need run into some confusion with python versions. This can also be fixed using pyenv but I like this more
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim
